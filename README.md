## 🔍 Analysis Focus

I explored the Uber Rides dataset to answer the following questions:

1. **Which month** sees the highest number of Uber rides booked?
2. **Which day of the week** Uber rides are booked the most?
3. **Which category** of Uber rides is booked the most?
4. **What’s the most common purpose** for booking an Uber ride?
5. **Which distance range** are Uber rides most commonly booked for?
6. **When are Uber rides booked the least?**
7. **At what time of day** do people book Uber rides the most?

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Highest bookings by month:** Identified the month with the highest Uber ride bookings.
- **Day of the week:** Found patterns in booking frequency based on days of the week.
- **Popular categories:** Determined the category of Uber rides with the highest number of bookings.
- **Common purposes:** Analyzed what purposes are most commonly associated with Uber ride bookings.
- **Distance analysis:** Explored which distances are more likely to be associated with Uber bookings.
- **Least frequent bookings:** Identified months and times when Uber rides are booked the least.

## 📈 Visualizations

The project also includes a series of visualizations to help understand the data better:

- **Bar plots** to show the distribution of rides across different days, months, and categories.
- **Line graphs** to track booking trends over time.
- **Heatmaps** to visualize ride frequency based on time of day.

## 🚀 Skills Gained

This project allowed me to:

- Improve my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** skills.
- Gain hands-on experience with **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**.
- Learn how to present data-driven insights to drive business decisions.
- Understand how to work on projects and submit data to companies in a structured manner.

## 💡 Insights and Business Impact
